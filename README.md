# Optimizing Delivery Driver Locations: A Causal Inference Approach

## Overview:

Gokada, Nigeriaâ€™s largest last-mile delivery service, has successfully completed over a million deliveries in Lagos with a fleet of more than 1200 riders. However, as the service expands, Gokada faces the challenge of sub-optimal placement of pilots (drivers) and clients, leading to a high number of unfulfilled delivery requests. To address this issue, Gokada has enlisted the help of 10 Academy trainees to analyze data, understand the primary causes of unfulfilled requests, and recommend optimal driver locations to increase the fraction of completed orders.
